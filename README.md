# SBA 320H - React Web Application Project
Now, it is time for you to put everything you've learned to the test and apply it to a practical web application.

The content, context, and objective of your application is entirely up to you. Be creative, and think of something that will both allow you to demonstrate the skills you've acquired thus far and solve a need (practical or fictional).

Once you have an idea for your project, keeping the below requirements and resources in mind, speak to your instructor to have your project approved before you begin. This will ensure you're on the right track from the start, and not running into unforseen issues or wasting time on something that will not satisfy the assignment's objectives.



# Weather App Project 
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip={zip code},{country code}&appid={API key}
1. My project is a React weather app 

2. It lets users enter a U.S.A. ZIP code.

3. Fetches current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

4. Displays temperature, humidity, and descriptions.

5. Includes routing for a login page and a not-found page.

# Features
Default Weather Load: Automatically fetches and displays weather for ZIP code 60601 (Chicago, IL) on initial load.

Search Functionality: Users can search for weather using different ZIP codes via an input form.

Dynamic Weather Display: Real-time weather information is displayed using data fetched from a third-party weather API.

Modular Component Design: Cleanly organized components for navigation, weather display, form input, and routing.

Routing with React Router:

/WeatherDisplay: Main weather page

/auth: Placeholder for authentication or login

*: Custom 404 page for invalid routes

# Technologies used
React – Functional components and hooks

React Router DOM  – For client-side routing

Fetch / Axios (depending on implementation) – For weather API calls

CSS / Styled Components / Tailwind (optional) – For UI styling
